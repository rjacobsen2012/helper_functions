##Methods Included

####array_values_to_keys($array)
	This method takes an array, and returns an associative array where the keys are 
	now what were the values.

	returns an array

####array_compare($array1, $array2)
	Function to compare 2 arrays to see if they match.

	returns true if they match, false if they do not

####return_keys_value_if_exists($key, $array_to_search)
	Checks if the array key exists.

	returns the value if the key exists, or returns null

####sort_multi_array_by_key($array, $key, $order)

	returns array

####create_temp_csv($csvdata)
	This method creates a temporary csv for email.

	returns the contents of the csv

####email_exception($errors, $email, $extra)
	This method emails the exception that was thrown to the email provided, along 
	with whatever you put in the $extra value.

	returns void

####pp($x, $die, $mail)
	This method was added to display array and objects clearer. Call this command 
	anywhere in your code by pp($testdata). This command does the same thing as the 
	php print_r method, but with <pre></pre> tags around the result.
	
	Setting the $die to true will kill the process when the method is called.
	
	The $mail option, if filled with an email address, will send an email to the 
	email with the result of the method. This is helpfull when trying to debug code 
	you cannot display the output from.
	
	returns void

####timestamp()
	This simply returns the current timestamp formatted for a database.

	returns string

####remove_namespace_from_class_name($model)
	There are instances where we want to get table names and attributes directly from 
	the model name, or load routes from controller class names. The namespace gets in 
	the way in these cases, so this helper just strips off the namespace.

	returns string

####null_or_empty($value)
	Checks if the value is null or empty.

	returns true if the $value is empty, false if the $value is not empty and not 
	null.

####search_operators()
	Function to return a list of DB operators for searching.

	returns array

####createmsg($logger, $msg, $log, $datestamp, $newline)
	This method can be called from anywhere in your code to log a string to a 
	specific log file. It can alternatively be used as a way to show status of 
	methods by passing different parameters.
	
	If you want to log the message, simply set the $log to true. The $logger must be 
	an instance of Logger, or null. If $logger is null, nothing will be logged.
	
	If you fill the $datestamp, there will be a timestamp in front of your message.
	
	If the $newline is set to true, it will add a line break at the end of the 
	message.

	returns void

####convert_state($name, $to)

####objToArray($obj, $arr)
	This method will convert objects to arrays.

	returns array

####create_zip($files, $destination, $overwrite)
	Creates a compressed zip file from the files passed, and if the $destination is 
	set, writes the files to the $destination. If the $overwrite value is true, this 
	will overwrite the current file.

	returns false - if no $files were passed, if the $destination does not exists, or 
	if the $overwrite option is set to false and the file exists already - or returns 
	string containing the file location
